      <h2 class="h1">What is ProofZoom?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        ProofZoom is a curated archive of mathematical proofs that have been carefully examined,
        logically audited, and—where necessary—repaired. Many standard proofs in textbooks and
        lecture notes contain small gaps, illicit steps, or quiet handwaving that are usually harmless,
        but pedagogically damaging. The goal of ProofZoom is to slow down, zoom in, and make every step honest.

          A standard proof often “inherits” tags under refinement (not a legitimate tagged partition).
          We diagnose the issue and give a fully tag-honest repaired proof.

        <p class="meta">How entries are structured</p>
        <p class="small">
          Each ProofZoom entry contains: (i) a commonly taught proof (or proof skeleton),
          (ii) identification of a subtle logical gap or illicit step,
          (iii) a diagnosis explaining why it is illegitimate,
          (iv) a repaired proof that respects all definitions,
          and (v) brief commentary on what changed and why it matters.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          Proofs are developed through careful human analysis in collaboration with an AI proof-analysis and writing system.
