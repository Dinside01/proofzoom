      ProofZoom is devoted to the deepening of mathematical understanding.
      Its purpose is not primarily the announcement of new results, but the
      clarification, illumination, and strengthening of existing mathematics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many mathematical results are known, yet not fully understood. Proofs may
      be technically correct but conceptually opaque, or scattered across sources
      in ways that obscure their underlying structure. ProofZoom seeks to bring
      such mathematics into clearer focus: to explain why results are true, to
      repair gaps or obscurities in exposition, and to present arguments in forms
      that reveal their essential ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this role, ProofZoom stands as a companion to the mathematical literature.
      It does not compete with research journals, but complements them by deepening
      comprehension, refining exposition, and preserving clarity for future readers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The long-term aim is to build a carefully curated archive of explanations,
      proofs, and clarifying notes that help mathematicians and students alike see
      more clearly into the structure of mathematics.
